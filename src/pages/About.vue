        Electrify Chicago is an independent open-source project looking to shed light onto one of
        the biggest sources of Chicago's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions - buildings. By providing more
        information about some of the city's largest and most polluting buildings, we hope t
        encourage these buildings to electrify, particularly by mobilizing people related to the
        building - whether that be students and faculty for a college building or employees and
        patients at a hospital.

        In simple terms, because we can scalably produce electricity without emitting CO<sub>2</sub>
        and exacerbating the climate crisis. In fact, <em>this decade</em> (the 2020s) is an
        especially crucial one for tackling climate change
        (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/climate/global-warming-ipcc-earth.html">
          &ldquo;World Has Less Than a Decade to Stop Catastrophic Warming&hellip;&rdquo;
          | The New York Times
        </a>), and shifting away from burning fossil fuels to using
        electricity
        <strong>today</strong> is a crucial step in that journey.
      </p>

      <p class="constrained">
        Even better, <strong>
          Illinois' grid in particular is already powered mostly by carbon-free
          energy
        </strong> and is improving every year!
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that buildings using only electricity cause less emissions every year as the
        power grid is moved to carbon-free sources, without any further changes to the building.
        On the other hand, fossil-fuel powered appliances will continue to emit as long as they are
        used.
